You'll need it for creating a story line, for innovative modelling, for developing new tools, different ways to data collection and lots more. Finally, Critical thinking is very useful in DS as a DStist should be able to develop questions and question the data as well.\n",

You'll have to translate your technical findings claerly and fluently into other things. You'll need good presentation skills, story-telling skills & listening skills. In short, make sure you build lasting relationships through your communication.\n",

Learning and Mastering atleast one of them is essential to realise various functions of data science but at the same time just a single language can solve problems in all areas. Python is most widely used langauage in the world today when it comes to data science. The next widely used language is R programming. If you're doing applied data science viz-viz, then you've got to learn python because that's the most valuable programming language for a data scientist.
